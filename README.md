# Livingstone Rwagatare - Personal Portfolio

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built with **React** and **Vite**, featuring interactive design elements and a focus on storytelling. This application showcases my journey from Rwamagana to MIT, highlighting my work in embedding empathy into algorithms.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive "Anti-Gravity" Background**: A custom HTML5 Canvas animation with floating nodes ("Empathy", "Algorithms", "Impact") that repel from the mouse cursor and serve as clickable navigation links.
- **Narrative-Driven Design**: Sections designed to tell a cohesive story of technical expertise and social impact.
- **Project Image Carousel**: Expandable project cards that open into a detailed modal with a smooth horizontal image carousel (snap-scrolling) to showcase multiple project views.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile devices.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Glassmorphism header with scroll-spy and smooth scrolling to sections.
- **Dark Mode Aesthetic**: A premium dark theme with gold accents, optimized for readability and visual appeal.
